Fermented Tomighty
====================

This is a potential revival of the .NET version of Tomighty. Why potential? Because I'm not yet sure if I'll begin it.

There's no intention of keeping it compatible with the original.

Development Workflow
====================

~~We follow the development model presented by Vincent Driessen:~~ The original project followed the development model presented by Vincent Driessen.

As later advised by the same Vincent Driessen, this project will use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) instead. If it'd begin at all.
